# Android fundamentals 02.2: Activity lifecycle and state

## What you should already know

You should be able to:

-   Create and running an app project in Android Studio.
-   Add log statements to your app and viewing those logs in the  **Logcat**  pane.
-   Understand and work with an  `Activity`  and an  `Intent`, and be comfortable interacting with them.

## What you'll learn

-   How the  `Activity`  lifecycle works.
-   When an  `Activity`  starts, pauses, stops, and is destroyed.
-   About the lifecycle callback methods associated with  `Activity`  changes.
-   The effect of actions (such as configuration changes) that can result in  `Activity`  lifecycle events.
-   How to retain  `Activity`  state across lifecycle events.

## What you'll do

-   Add code to the TwoActivities app from the previous practical to implement the various  `Activity`  lifecycle callbacks to include logging statements.
-   Observe the state changes as your app runs and as you interact with each  `Activity`  in your app.
-   Modify your app to retain the instance state of an  `Activity`  that is unexpectedly recreated in response to user behavior or configuration change on the device.
